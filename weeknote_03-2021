# Weeknote 03-2021
It's been weeks since I last wrote the weekly notes. I'm not sure why I didn't write. I haven't been busy on Saturdays or Sundays, yet I didn't feel as writing.

One reason can be that I'm feeling overwhelmed with [my thesis project](/tags/libraries). There's regular reading, writing and synthesising but I don't seem to make any progress.

Although I'm fond of the topic, I haven't gotten around to write about it as I planned. I feel insecure about my knowledge, so I'm hesitant to publish.

More I read about different topics, more I detect holes in my understanding. Or I have the fear that I'm not quoting the original idea but paraphrasing somebody's else research. It's a weird struggle and internal battle.

Yet, if I look at my past 2 weeks reading, then there's so many long and nuanced analysis on other topics. If I analyse myself retrospectively, then the consumption has increased over the few weeks. Still, I'm struggling to write or create anything related. So, it might be [a sign of creative burnout](https://nesslabs.com/creative-burnout).

Returning to the thesis project, we have a monthly checkpoint next Saturday. We should present our progress with insights. I'm counting the deadline to overcome the procrastination. I want to piece together a wholesome view of public libraries, their role in society (also how it has changed) and why they might be the best tool addressing the most significant challenges that wait ahead.

The following step is to start finding a specific problem to build a sample case and prove the value in real life.

### What I’ve been thinking about
In the [latest Dense Discovery, Kai Brach](https://www.densediscovery.com/issues/120) discusses reading for fun. He argues how Silicon Valley has ruined our reading experience. We consume books like we would teach computers.

I couldn't agree more.

From the beginning of January, I joined a book subscription. They send 1 book once a month, and I chose specialty as Japanese literature.
The first book is The Box Man by Kōbō Abe.

I'm 40 pages in, and I've found an interest in fiction writing. It might be an excellent book, but I'm overcoming my rule that I dislike fiction literature. 

I might have been under the illusion that the books should be only consumed for knowledge. And I shouldn't waste my time on stories that are made up.

### What I’ve been reading
- [The race for renewables is burning Europe's forests](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/14/carbon-neutrality-is-a-fairy-tale-how-the-race-for-renewables-is-burning-europes-forests).
- We need to walk away from the idea that shopping is the solution to our problems, and accept that [everything we buy impacts the planet](https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/epdx8j/your-sneaker-habit-is-destroying-the-planet).
- Capitalism excels at innovation but is failing at maintenance, and for most lives, [it is maintenance that matters more](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/hail-the-maintainers).
- Anyone working in finance & tech is living in a mental future that far outpaces the physical present. [The pandemic's takeaway](https://virtualelena.substack.com/p/bit-structures) is that there is a massive asymmetry in the power, vision, and will between technology/engineering/logistics, the government, and human volition.
- The [New European Bauhaus](https://medium.com/iipp-blog/can-the-new-european-bauhaus-reorient-design-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-e99b045003a2) is an opportunity to reinvent our design, art and architecture practices, just as it's the reinvention of Europe.
- [Design Thinking is so entrenched in capitalism](https://flatjournal.com/work/design-thinking-is-rebrand-for-white-supremacy/) that the substitution of "human-centred design" is only "human" about the underlying business model. And this is why criticism on Design Thinking, does not provide a vocabulary for an alternative outside of capitalism.
- [Treating the design organization as a service](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/service-based-design-org/) clarifies how important it is to every part of the business.
- [Counterculture is difficult to see in the internet era](https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/01/the-internet-didnt-kill-counterculture-you-just-wont-find-it-on-instagram/), and even harder to find—that doesn't mean it's not there.
- [Streetwear and its collaborations are not impressive anymore](https://www.rubypseudo.com/blog/read-the-room-streetwear/), it's frustrating, rude, and crass as hell.
- An extraordinary look at [the everyday life in Georgia under Soviet rule](https://www.lensculture.com/articles/rezo-kezali-a-suitcase-of-negatives).
